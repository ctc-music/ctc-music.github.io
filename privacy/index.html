        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how Website Operator (&quot;Website Operator&quot;,
            &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable
            information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;)
            may
            provide on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cutthecord.de">cutthecord.de</a> website and
            any
            of its products or services (collectively, &quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
        <p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
            access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not
            own
            or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
        <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
        <p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We process only
            minimal
            user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website or Services. Information
            collected
            automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
            regarding
            Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify
            any
            particular user of the system.</p>
        <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
        <p>You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could
            identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website's
            features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
            address).
            We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online forms on the
            Website.
            You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
            advantage
            of some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome
            to
            contact us.</p>
        <h2>Storing personal information</h2>
        <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations,
            resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
            law.
            We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
            delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
            Personal
            Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification
            and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
        <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
        <p>In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect
            and
            use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able
            to
            provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you
            via
            our Website. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources. Any of the
            information we collect from you may be used to help us run and operate our Website and Services.</p>
        <p>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website, where you are located in
            the
            world and if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific
            purposes.
            This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
            Consumer
            Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance
            of
            an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is
            carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
        <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
            processing
            (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any
            case,
            we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
            whether
            the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary
            to
            enter into a contract.</p>
        <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country
            other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country
            outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set
            up
            by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your
            information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of
            this
            document or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
        <h2>The rights of users</h2>
        <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right
            to
            do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to
            the
            processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if
            the
            processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if
            information
            is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of
            the
            information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and
            ask
            for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
            processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other
            than
            storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal
            Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and
            machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without
            any
            hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and
            that
            the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual
            obligations
            thereof.</p>
        <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
        <p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
            vested
            in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by
            providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that,
            however,
            should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that
            processing
            at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information
            for
            direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>
        <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
        <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to Website Operator through the contact details provided
            in
            this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by Website Operator as
            early
            as possible.</p>
        <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the
            age
            of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website or Service. We encourage parents
            and
            legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
            their
            children never to provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without their permission.</p>
        <p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us
            through
            our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
            processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or
            guardian
            to do so on your behalf).</p>

            but
            you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline

        <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to
            have
            your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with
            a
            website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from
            consumers
            who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers
            communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to
            interpret
            or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail
            throughout
            this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Information security</h2>
        <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
            unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
            safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of

            can
            be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)

            and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and our Website cannot be guaranteed;

            (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best
            efforts.</p>

            limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
            authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals
            if we
            believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is
